## Tor Still Works
- In general, Tor has no been cracked on a cryptographic level, and does hide your online activity.
  - Browser bugs and user misconfigurations can cause trouble for Tor users.
  - Monitoring agents can deduce online activity on Tor by piecing together the users regular network activity and the activity logged in Tor site.
 
## Tor is Not Only Used by Criminals
- Tor can and is used by anyone wanting to protect their data, and communicate securely and anonymously.

## Tor Does Not Have a Military Backdoor
- Although Tor was originally funded by the US Navy, there is no military backdoor.
- Cryptographers and security pros have verified it, and condirmed Tor remains a safe open source tool.

## No One in the US Has Been Prosecuted For Running a Tor Relay
- EFF believes there are no laws in the US preventing the usage of a Tor relay, and there have not been any instances of indictments.
- A Tor relay receives network traffic on Tor network and passes it along.

## Tor is Easy to Use
- Tor is easy to download, install  and use from the correct sources.

## Tor is Not as Slow as You Think
- Privacy comes at a small cost of slower latency, but Tor is not as slow as you might expect.

## Tor is Not Foolproof
- Tor is a great tool for online anonymity and privacy, but the user must still be mindful of how they use it.
- Logging into common services like Google will show the communication on their end.



# Tor

Using Mac OS terminal: 
- I installed Tor with Homebrew using the command 'brew install tor'
- I then installed Tor browser with the command 'brew install --cask tor-browser'
- And launched the browser with the command 'open -a "Tor Browser"'
- Tor broswer opened and I connected the network, and searched for 'ahmia'
- Ahmia search engine opened to the regular version, and I onionised it form the top right corner:

- I simply searched for 'drugs' and found countless similar websites and randomly chose one
- Leading to a great deal for pressed Donald Trump pills

- After, I searched for 'forums' and found the site Internet Archive
- The site had forums from television to genealogy all the way to Western Socialist 1965-1980
- A mix bag for anyone to find their interest

- Next, I thought I'd search for a news organisation to see if I could find a .onion website for them
- I chose the New York Times, and found a website with a descrption of the NYT page and details on when it was launched

- I clicked the link, and it opened the NYT onion website
- Comparing to the regular site, it was essentially identical
