## Abstract 
- An evolution in network protection is required to counteract a more advanced method of attack - APT.
- APT's (Adnvanced Persistent Threat) are conducted by highly skilled individuals over a long period of time with the tools to bypass conventional network defences in order to gain access to essential systems and sensitive data.
- Defence actors can utilise the long-winded process to evaluate incoming threat techniques, and enhance mitigating actions for better success in future attacks.
- The kill chain model can be used to follow the bread crumbs of attackers to build a big picture view of their objectives.

## Introduction
- Succesful ATP attacks on highly classified entities proved a necessity to create more robust defensive measures compared to traditional blockades on automated attacks.
- An intelligence-driven approach is needed to combat sophisticated ATP attacks.
- The kill chain model represents each phase an attacker must go through to complete their objective succesfully, and preventing them in any one of the steps can greatly alleviate the probablity of success.

## Related Work
- Phase based defensive models are a common tool in developing and assesing counter measures.
- The US military forces apply a kill chain model for situational scenarios, and the US Department of Defence classifies their kill chain phase based model to include the steps: find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess.

## Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense
- Intelligence-driven CND requires understanding of the adversary along with following the overall goal if intrusion attempts rather than focusing on one-time attacks.
- APT's are essentially defended with the same or higher level persistance.

## Indicators and the Indicator Life Cycle
- Indicators are an essential part in locating intrusions and harnessing them to locate more.
- Indicators are divided into three types:
 - Atomic - A basic form of data that retains its essence such as an IP address.
 - Computed - Genterated types of data such as hash values.
 - Behavioral - A combination of the two former types of data that an attacker utilises to further their objective.
