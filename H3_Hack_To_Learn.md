- The gaming industry involves billions of people, and circulates massive amounts of money annually, which is why cyber security is an integral part of the grand scheme.

- Multiplayer and online games are the most popular globally. Players can harmfully be affected by:
   - DDoS
 - Data security breaches
 - In-game transaction failure

- Game developers spend countless hours developing their games, and they need assurance their hard work is protected from:
 - Intellectual property theft
 - Game infrastructure exploitation

- Robust protection can be achieved by using, and fully understanding a suitable cyber security architecture.
- Utilising the secure software development life cycle (SSDLC) process can mitigate potential vulnerabilities, and create a framework of best practices to follow.
 - SSDLC includes: Training -> Requirements -> Design -> Implementation -> Verification -> Release -> Response
- Industry standards, frameworks, and regulations promote cyber security.
 - GDPR in Europe
 - PCI DSS for secure transactions.

- Individual players can account for a good amount of security in gaming by following basic cyber security practices like account and password management.
